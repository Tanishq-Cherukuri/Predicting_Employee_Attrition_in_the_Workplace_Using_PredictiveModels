🔍 Predicting Employee Attrition Using Machine Learning
This project explores the use of machine learning models to predict employee attrition, helping organizations proactively address workforce retention challenges. High attrition impacts productivity, morale, and financial performance. By leveraging predictive analytics, this project identifies key factors behind employee turnover and recommends data-driven strategies to reduce it.

🧠 Objectives
Develop predictive models to identify employees at risk of leaving.

Analyze patterns and key factors influencing attrition.

Recommend actionable strategies to improve employee retention.

📊 Dataset
Source: Kaggle - HR Analytics Dataset

1,470 employee records with 35 variables including age, job role, satisfaction, income, and work-life balance metrics.

📈 Key Insights
Attrition is higher among:

Sales & HR departments

Employees aged 25–35

Those with frequent business travel

Employees with lower income or long commutes

Factors like Monthly Income, Overtime, Age, and Distance from Home were strong attrition predictors.
